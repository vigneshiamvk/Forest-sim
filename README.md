# Forest Simulation

This repository contains a browser-based simulation of a simple 2D forest ecosystem. Everything lives in the `forest.html` file.

## Features

- Grass that regrows and spreads over time
- Rabbits that roam the grid, eat grass, flee from foxes and reproduce when they have enough energy
- Foxes that hunt rabbits, rest when tired and reproduce as well
- A pause/resume control and live display of the current day, time and population counts

## Running the simulation

Open `forest.html` in a modern web browser. The simulation starts automatically and you can pause or resume it using the button in the top-left corner.

---
The simulation logic is implemented entirely in JavaScript within the HTML file, so no build steps or additional dependencies are required.
